👋 Hello สวัสดี こんにちは 你好

My name is Visatouch. My nickname is Boat.
Also use "xerodotc" as an alias on the internet.
I'm a software engineer working at Google Taiwan.

I have interests and passions for innovations and technologies that will impact everyday life and improve our standard of living. Stand for people’s freedom, liberty and democracy. Against any form of authoritarianism.

I like Japanese pop cultures (i.e. anime, manga, music, games, seiyuus, and concerts).
BanG Dream! is my personal favorite series, and I would describe myself as BanGDreamer (BanG Dream! fan).
